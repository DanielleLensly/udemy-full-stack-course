		<h2>The important stuff</h2>
		<p>I'm a frontend web dev and have been working in this position for 4 years. My main focus was on Drupal projects: building components, styling them, and sending for QA. I'm detail oriented and can proudly say my failed tickets were a lot less than the passed. <br />
		I'm an animal lover, I have 2 cats. My husband got to name one, Neko, and I got to name one, Alexstrasza (Lexi).<br />
		I love to play video games, especially World of Warcraft. I also love to read, my favorite genres are fantasy, crime solving stuff, and YA. I also love to go to concerts, my favorite bands are Rammstein, Electric Callboy, and Babymetal. My ideal date would be a Download fest type thing with these 3 bands, I could die happily after.</p>
